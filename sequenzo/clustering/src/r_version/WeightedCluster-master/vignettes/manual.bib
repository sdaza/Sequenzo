	of the Lance and Williams' formula which enables the implementation

	The test also demonstrates the value of OM and sequence comparison
	in examining occupational sequences; both methods capture variation
	beyond traditional human capital and status attainment measures,
	although the marginal improvements of OM over sequence comparison
	may not justify its computational complexity. These results point
	to the need for more systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.},

	the sum of the pairwise products of the weights on the corresponding
	edges of the two graphs. The gamma statistic is a direct generalization
	of the commonly used clustering indices and reduces to the number

	more information from the protocol graph R than does gamma and incorporates
	a distance measured based on the number of intervening items in a

  journal = {Sociological Methods Research},

  volume = {38},
  pages = {389-419},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting
	on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover
	when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance
	between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines
	what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion
	and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective
	of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous
	similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs,
	the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions
	are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein
	II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence.
	When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be
	favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally,
	substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account
	the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the
	timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations
	with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies
	whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined
	dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling
	of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time
	use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming
	and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity
	measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as
	measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones.},

	of such algorithms re fers to the problem of determining the ability
	of the methods to recover cluster configurations which are known

	methods. Next, interpretation and inference procedures in cluster
	anal ysis are discussed. inference procedures involve test ing for
	significant cluster structure and the problem of determining the
	number of clusters in the data. The paper concludes with two sets
	of recommendations. One set deals with topics in clustering that
	would ben efit from continued research into the methodology. The

	for differences between groups, a pseudo-R 2 for measuring the strength
