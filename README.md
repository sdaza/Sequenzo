# Sequenzo: Fast, scalable, and intuitive social sequence analysis

Sequenzo is a high-performance Python package designed for social sequence analysis. It is built to analyze **any sequence of categorical events**, from individual career paths and migration patterns to corporate growth and urban development. 
Whether you are working with **people, places, or policies**, Sequenzo helps uncover meaningful patterns efficiently. 

Sequenzo outperforms traditional R-based tools in social sequence analysis, delivering faster processing and superior efficiency, especially for large-scale datasets. **No big data? No problem. You don’t need big data to benefit as Sequenzo is designed to enhance sequence analysis at any scale, making complex methods accessible to everyone.**

## Target Audience

Sequenzo is designed for:

- 🧑‍🎓 Quantitative researchers in sociology, demography, political science, economics, management, etc.
- 📊 Data scientists, data analysts, and business analysts working on trajectory/time-series clustering
- 🧑‍🏫 Educators teaching courses involving social sequence data
- 🔁 Users familiar with R packages like `TraMineR` who want a Python-native alternative


## Why Choose Sequenzo?

🚀 **High Performance**

Leverages Python’s computational power to achieve 10× faster processing than traditional R-based tools like TraMineR.

🎯 **Easy-to-Use API**

Designed with simplicity in mind: intuitive functions streamline complex sequence analysis without compromising flexibility.

🌍 **Flexible for Any Scenario**

Perfect for research, policy, and business, enabling seamless analysis of categorical data and its evolution over time.

## Documentation

Explore the full Sequenzo documentation [here](sequenzo.yuqi-liang.tech). Even though the documentation website is still under construction, you can already find some useful information there.

**Where to start on the documentation website?**
* New to Sequenzo or social sequence analysis? Begin with "About Sequenzo" → "Quickstart Guide" for a smooth introduction.
* Got your own data? After going through "About Sequenzo" and "Quickstart Guide", you are ready to dive in and start analyzing.
* Looking for more? Check out our example datasets and tutorials to deepen your understanding.

For Chinese users, additional tutorials are available on [Yuqi's video tutorials on Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/263594713/lists/4147974).

## Installation

The latest stable release and required dependencies can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sequenzo/). You can type the following line in your terminal:

```
pip install sequenzo
```

If you have some issues with the installation, it might because you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your computer. In this case, you can try to use `pip3` instead of `pip` to install the package.

```
pip3 install sequenzo
```
