    "# Step-by-step Tutorial on Multi-Domain Sequence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-domain sequence analysis** is a powerful approach to studying life course trajectories across multiple interrelated domains — such as family, work, and education. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of analyzing each domain (e.g., marriage or childbearing) separately, this method allows us to capture how life events unfold *together* across different areas of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this important?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because real lives are complex. For example, getting married might affect when someone leaves home or starts having children. Ignoring these interconnections can lead to oversimplified or even misleading conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Will You Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prepare and align life course sequence data** across different domains  \n",
    "- **Assess the association** between domains to see if and how they are related  \n",
    "- Understand and apply the **four main strategies** for multi-domain sequence analysis:\n",
    "  1. **IDCD** – Individual Domain Combined Dynamics  \n",
    "  2. **CAT** – Concatenation of Aligned Trajectories  \n",
    "  3. **DAT** – Distance Aggregation Technique  \n",
    "  4. **CombT** – Combined Typology Strategy  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each strategy has its own logic and use case. We'll use the `biofam` dataset from the `MedSeq` R package to illustrate the key differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're exploring family formation, education-employment transitions, or any multi-domain longitudinal data, this tutorial will provide you with a comprehensive hands-on introduction.\n",

    "## The first strategy to conduct multi-domain sequence analysis: IDCD - Individual Domain Combined Dynamics \n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of analyzing each domain separately, **IDCD looks at what's happening in all domains *at the same time*, at every point in the life course**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way:  \n",
    "* At each age, a person is in **one specific state** in each domain (e.g., *not married*, *has no children*, *still lives at home*).  \n",
    "* IDCD creates a **combined state** from these — so now you're tracking sequences like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `At home + No child + Single` → `Left home + No child + Single` → `Left home + Child + Married` → ...\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in **a new combined sequence** for each individual, reflecting how their entire life unfolds across all domains *together*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It gives a **rich and detailed picture** of how domains evolve in parallel.\n",
    "- We can directly compare full life-course trajectories that combine domains.\n",
    "- It enables **standard sequence analysis** (like clustering, visualization, etc.) to be applied to these combined sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have three life domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leaving home** — [0 = At home, 1 = Left home]  \n",
    "2. **Having children** — [0 = No child, 1 = Has child]  \n",
    "3. **Marital status** — [0 = Single, 1 = Married]\n",
    "\n",
    "At age 18, a person might be:\n",
    "- At home (0)\n",
    "- No child (0)\n",
    "- Single (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "→ So we represent this as: `0+0+0`\n",
    "\n",
    "At age 24, they might be:\n",
    "- Left home (1)\n",
    "- Has child (1)\n",
    "- Married (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "→ That becomes: `1+1+1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The full sequence might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `0+0+0 → 0+0+0 → 1+0+0 → 1+0+1 → 1+1+1`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can You Do With This?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have these combined sequences, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the most common patterns of life-course combinations\n",
    "- Cluster individuals based on similar life trajectories\n",
    "- Study the diversity and timing of transitions across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, **IDCD lets us zoom out and look at full life paths in a multidimensional way**, while keeping all the timing information intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to try it out? Let’s construct combined sequences using the IDCD approach.\n"

    "## The second strategy for multi-domain sequence analysis: CAT — Concatenation of Aligned Trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "While **IDCD combines all domains at each point in time**, **CAT simply *sticks the domains together* — one after another** — to form one long “super sequence.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of CAT as **gluing together** the individual sequences from each domain, rather than fusing them in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you’re tracking a person’s life from age 15 to 30, across three domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leaving home** (16 years of data)  \n",
    "2. **Having children** (16 years)  \n",
    "3. **Marital status** (16 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each domain is a sequence on its own — like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leaving home: `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, ..., 1`\n",
    "- Having children: `0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ..., 1`\n",
    "- Marriage: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAT just puts them side-by-side** into a single sequence of length 48:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `0, 0, 0, ..., 1` (Leaving home)  \n",
    "> `0, 0, 0, ..., 1` (Children)  \n",
    "> `0, 0, 0, ..., 1` (Marriage)\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Final CAT sequence:  \n",
    "`0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s still **a single sequence per individual**, but **the three domains are placed sequentially, not simultaneously**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Is This Different from IDCD?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature              | IDCD                               | CAT                                  |\n",
    "|----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n",
    "| How domains are used | Combined *at each point in time*    | Placed one *after another*            |\n",
    "| Sequence length      | Same as one domain (e.g., 16)       | Sum of all domain lengths (e.g., 48)  |\n",
    "| Goal                 | Capture *inter-domain synchronicity*| Capture *overall life trajectory*     |\n",
    "| Example unit         | `\"0+0+1\"` (combined state)          | `0, 0, 0, ..., 1` (concatenated states)|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use CAT?\n",
    "\n",
    "- You preserve the **order of events across all domains**, even when they happen at different times.\n",
    "- You avoid creating *too many combined states* (a problem in IDCD when domains have many states).\n",
    "- You can **use standard sequence clustering tools**, treating each CAT sequence as a “full life history.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine three people:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person | Leaving Home       | Children           | Marriage          |\n",
    "|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| A      | `0, 0, 1, 1, ...`  | `0, 0, 0, 1, ...`  | `0, 0, 0, 0, ...` |\n",
    "| B      | `0, 1, 1, 1, ...`  | `0, 0, 0, 0, ...`  | `0, 1, 1, 1, ...` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Their CAT sequences would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A**: `[0, 0, 1, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\n",
    "- **B**: `[0, 1, 1, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1, 1, ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now **cluster** people based on these full-path patterns — and ask questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Are there typical paths through life when we look across all domains, not just one?”\n",
    "\n"

    "## The third strategy for multi-domain sequence analysis: DAT — Distance Aggregation of Trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "**DAT** takes a very different approach compared to IDCD and CAT. Instead of modifying or combining the sequences directly, **DAT combines the distances between sequences** across multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t always need to *combine the sequences* — sometimes, it’s better to **combine how different people are similar or different** in each domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAT works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In each domain (e.g., marriage, children, leaving home), compute **a distance matrix** — how different is person A from B in that domain?\n",
    "2. Then, **aggregate these distances** across domains into a single distance matrix.\n",
    "3. Use this combined distance matrix for **clustering or visualization**, as if it came from one “meta-domain.”\n",
    "\n",
    "> DAT is like comparing *life patterns* instead of *life states*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition: Distance-first, not sequence-first\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two people:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person | Marriage            | Children           | Leaving Home       |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| A      | `0, 0, 0, 1, 1...`  | `0, 0, 1, 1, 1...` | `0, 1, 1, 1, 1...` |\n",
    "| B      | `0, 0, 0, 0, 1...`  | `0, 0, 0, 1, 1...` | `0, 0, 1, 1, 1...` |\n",
    "\n",
    "- In each domain, we can calculate how similar A and B are.\n",
    "- Then DAT aggregates these three distances (e.g., by adding or averaging them) to get **a global distance** between A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "We **never need to combine sequences** directly — just the distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation can be done in various ways:\n",
    "- **Sum of distances** across domains (default)\n",
    "- **Weighted sum** (e.g., some domains are more important)\n",
    "- Other tricks like **normalization**, if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "The key requirement is that all distance matrices are comparable — e.g., based on the same method like Optimal Matching (OM), DHD, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DAT Differs from Other Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | How it combines domains             | Key unit for analysis        |\n",
    "|----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n",
    "| IDCD     | Fuses *states* at each time point   | Combined state sequences     |\n",
    "| CAT      | Concatenates domain sequences       | One long sequence per person |\n",
    "| **DAT**  | Aggregates *distances* between people| Combined distance matrix     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we compute **pairwise distances** between 2,000 individuals in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Domain 1 (Leaving Home): `D₁`\n",
    "- Domain 2 (Children): `D₂`\n",
    "- Domain 3 (Marriage): `D₃`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the **DAT distance** between Person A and B is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `DAT_Distance(A,B) = D₁(A,B) + D₂(A,B) + D₃(A,B)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this full matrix, we can use it with:\n",
    "- Hierarchical clustering\n",
    "- MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)\n",
    "- t-SNE or UMAP\n",
    "\n",
    "→ All based on overall **similarity across life domains**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use DAT?\n",
    "\n",
    "- You **don’t lose detail** by merging states or sequences.\n",
    "- You can mix **different distance methods** per domain if needed.\n",
    "- It’s **statistically elegant** — it focuses on *structure* of similarity, not exact paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "You can still examine:\n",
    "- Which domain contributes most to the distance\n",
    "- Whether certain clusters are closer in some domains than others\n",
    "\n",
    "DAT offers **flexibility** and **modularity** — especially when domains are hard to align or interpret jointly.\n",
    "\n"

    "## The fourth strategy for multi-domain sequence analysis: CombT — Combined Typology\n",
    "\n",
    "**CombT** stands for **Combined Typology**, and it's a helpful strategy when you want to cluster individuals **based on their patterns in each domain separately**, then **combine** those domain-level clusters into one **global typology**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than trying to forcefully merge different life domains (like in IDCD or CAT), **CombT lets each domain speak for itself first**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster each domain **individually** using its own distance matrix.\n",
    "2. Assign each individual a **cluster label** per domain.\n",
    "3. Combine these labels (like \"LeftCluster=1 + ChildCluster=2 + MarriedCluster=1\") into a new string — this is the **Combined Typology (CombT)**.\n",
    "4. Optionally, merge rare combinations if needed (e.g., clusters with too few people).\n",
    "\n",
    "> So an individual's CombT label might look like: `\"2+1+3\"` → Cluster 2 in Domain A, Cluster 1 in Domain B, Cluster 3 in Domain C.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Get\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is:\n",
    "- A **membership table** showing each person’s cluster per domain and their final CombT label.\n",
    "- A **frequency table** showing how common each combination is.\n",
    "- A barplot for quick visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have three domains:\n",
    "- Leaving home (6 clusters)\n",
    "- Having children (5 clusters)\n",
    "- Getting married (4 clusters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining those clusters could give **up to 6 × 5 × 4 = 120 possible CombTs** — but usually far fewer are actually observed in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example CombTs:\n",
    "- `\"1+1+1\"` → A very traditional trajectory\n",
    "- `\"4+5+2\"` → A more unconventional path\n",
    "- `\"3+1+4\"` → Something in-between\n",
    "\n",
    "These labels let us **analyze patterns of life-course diversity** at a higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "CombT is particularly helpful when:\n",
    "- Domains are **distinct**, but each one is important.\n",
    "- You want to **respect the structure of each domain**, but still form a unified typology.\n",
    "- You want a result that is **interpretable**, traceable back to domain-specific behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merge Rare Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, a few CombT types are very rare (e.g., only 1 or 2 people). You can:\n",
    "- Merge them with similar, larger groups\n",
    "- Ensure that the final typology is **stable**, meaningful, and doesn’t overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually done using **silhouette score**: only merge if the quality of clustering (ASW) stays acceptable (e.g., ≥ 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CombT Compared to Other Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Core Logic                        | Sequence Input | Output        |\n",
    "|----------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n",
    "| IDCD     | Merge states per time point      | Aligned        | Single sequence |\n",
    "| CAT      | Concatenate full trajectories     | Aligned        | Long sequence   |\n",
    "| DAT      | Combine distances post hoc       | Any            | Distance matrix |\n",
    "| **CombT**| Cluster per domain, then combine | Any            | Typology label  |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- CombT = cluster in each domain + combine cluster labels\n",
    "- Great when domains are **independently meaningful**\n",
    "- Produces **interpretable and customizable** groupings\n",
    "- Allows further merging or simplification based on silhouette score\n",
    "\n",
